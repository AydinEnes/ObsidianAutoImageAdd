# Obsidian Image Embedding Script

I was tired of copy-pasting from folders to Obsidian all the time. This Python script helps you embed images into your Markdown files in an Obsidian vault. Choose between adding images from the same folder as the Markdown files or from an "attachments" folder.

## Note

- Be cautious with your Obsidian vault and path before running the script, especially for bulk changes.
- Images in "attachments" should be prefixed with the Markdown file name (e.g., `note1_image.png` for `note1.md`).
